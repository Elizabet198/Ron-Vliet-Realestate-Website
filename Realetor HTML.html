		<h4 class="heading-fourth">My Vision and Philosophy</h4>
			
			<p class="me-p-text">As the Owner and Broker of Portal Connecticut Realty, excellence in performance has always been my personal foundation. My success is proven over the last 18 years with over 300 bought/sold homes and a 100% customer satisfaction rating. I provide clients a relationship built on the greatest level of respect, sincerity, and ethical practice. These are unspoken rules a good Real Estate professional should always adhere to.</p>
			
			<h4 class="heading-fourth">Who am I?</h4>
			
			<p class="me-p-text">I'm one of the hardest-working guys you’ll ever want as your Real Estate advocate. I hold a degree in Business Administration from Mitchell College in New London, CT. While attending college full-time, I married my high school sweetheart, brought a beautiful baby boy into the world, worked full time nights to support my family, and pay off my student loans to start life debt free. We then had our second child, a daughter. As I was starting my professional side of life I quickly realized that I was excellent in sales and after 2-3 years I discovered my creative side. At 26 I started carving wood sculptured plaques ultimately leading to a full line of home decor wood products. Marketing and demand led to building a manufacturing plant employing 17. We sold the wooden art nationally to nature enthusiasts until, some years later, I sold the business. My sales skills continued to serve me well in the home decor sector as a manufacturer’s representative. I then started another company to manufacture engineered technical parts for companies across the US. I traveled worldwide and successfully negotiated many sensitive transactions. After 17 successful years and $1MM in annual sales, I decided to sell the business and went into Real Estate.  <br>

 

			<br>I enjoy working with people and here I am now enjoying the Real Estate world. I'm a super DIY’er - having designed home additions and remodeling projects of all kinds and variations what better a fit than the home buying and selling market.  My project experience includes the full design/build of HVAC systems, duct work, plumbing, electrical, framing, drywall, kitchen, finish work, and even exterior land excavation - with my own bulldozer front-end loader/backhoe.  I tell every client I help, I'm a Christian, I do not lie nor cheat and whether it be good news or bad news the truth must prevail.  At this point in my life, I wish only to sell a quality product and commissions are not my motivation – YOU ARE.  I PROMISE YOU; YOU WILL BE PLEASED AND COMPLETELY SATISFIED!   </p>
